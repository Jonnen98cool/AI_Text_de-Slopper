# AI Text de-Slopper
## Introduction
ChatGPT is great at generating text, but sometimes it just uses em dashes too liberally.

## Features
A simple match-and-replace tool, this program converts odd characters like `—`, `’` and `“` to their human counterparts which are `-`, `'` and `"` respectively.

### Usage
`python3 transform_file.py <my_file.txt>`<br><br>

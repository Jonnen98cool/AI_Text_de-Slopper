The Clockmaker’s Gift

In the quiet town of Willowmere stood a tiny shop wedged between a bakery and a bookstore. Its wooden sign read “Hollis Timepieces — Repairs & Restorations Since 1891.”

Few people went inside anymore. The shop smelled of brass polish and rain-soaked wood, and the only sound was the slow, steady ticking of hundreds of clocks — all slightly out of sync.

Mr. Hollis, the clockmaker, was a small, wiry man with silver hair that refused to lie flat. He spent his days surrounded by gears, pendulums, and faces without hands. But there was one clock he never touched — a tall grandfather clock in the corner, covered with a velvet cloth.

Every evening at precisely six, Mr. Hollis would stop whatever he was doing, pour a cup of tea, and sit before it. He’d whisper something under his breath, smile faintly, and then return to work.

One stormy night, a girl named Mae wandered in, soaked to the bone. “My grandmother’s pocket watch stopped,” she said, placing it on the counter. “She said it was a wedding gift from someone in Willowmere.”

Mr. Hollis peered at the watch. The initials E.H. were engraved on the back. His hands trembled. “I remember this,” he murmured. “I made it for her.”

Mae looked puzzled. “You knew her?”

He nodded. “A long time ago. Before the war. Before all this.”

As he repaired the watch, a strange thing happened — all the clocks in the shop began to tick in perfect unison. The sound filled the air like a heartbeat. When he finished, the old grandfather clock began to chime — something it hadn’t done in fifty years.

Mr. Hollis lifted the velvet cloth. Inside was a photo of a smiling woman holding a pocket watch — the same one Mae had brought.

“She was the one who taught me time wasn’t meant to be measured,” he said softly. “It was meant to be shared.”

The next morning, the shop was empty. The door was unlocked, the tools neatly arranged, and every clock perfectly still — except the grandfather clock, which ticked on, as if keeping time for someone who had finally found his rest.

Mae kept the pocket watch. And every evening at six, she could swear she heard faint chimes, somewhere in the distance — steady and sure.
